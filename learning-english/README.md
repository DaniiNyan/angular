# LearningEnglish

A simple learning english-portuguese application.

## How it works?
First you must run the application.  
1. Download this project:  
`git clone https://github.com/DaniiNyan/angular.git`
2. Navigate to the directory where the project was downloaded and run this command:  
`ng serve`  
3. The project must be running on `http://localhost:4200/`.  

In your browser, try to translate the sentence above the text area and click on `Validar Resposta`. If your answer is right, you'll go to the next sentence. If you fail, you'll lose one heart. The game ends when you pass through all sentences or when you lose all your hearts.

## Customization

Add as many sentences you want on `sentences.mocks.ts` file inside `src/app/shared` directory. You just have to follow the pattern to get it working.
